# Cloud Game Streaming

The project aims at creating a game streaming app  which would help the user to stream games from their own computers without the need of high gaming laptops with the higher quality specifications. The game will essentially run on the server side and the client will be able to play the game on their system. The client can access the game by paying some minimal charges and not actually by a gaming laptop which might cost them a fortune. The web app is built using the MERN stack and the game streaming is done essentially using Desktop Duplication API and using web sockets to transfer frames from the server to the client
